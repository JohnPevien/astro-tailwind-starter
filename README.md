# Astro Tailwind Starter
Astro with tailwind and primary blocks (nav, layout, footer)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blocks/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ navigation.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

The `src/components/` and `src/blocks` is where we would ideally put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components/blocks.


Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn install`         | Installs dependencies                            |
| `yarn dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `yarn build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `yarn preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
